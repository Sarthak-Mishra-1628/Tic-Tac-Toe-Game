# Tic Tac Toe Game 🎮

**My First Mini Project**

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns and play on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. The game also includes a reset feature to start a new round after each match.


# 📝 Features
- **Two-player gameplay :** Players take turns placing "X" and "O" on the board.
- **Winning Logic :** The game detects if a player wins or if the match results in a draw.
- **Reset Button :** Resets the board for a new game.
- **Responsive Design :** The game adjusts itself according to different screen sizes, making it playable on both mobile and desktop devices.


# 🎯 How to Play
- The game starts with Player "X".
- Click on an empty cell to place your mark.
- The first player to align three of their marks (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all cells are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.
- Use the Reset button to start a new game.
